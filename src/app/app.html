        <h1>Hello! I Am Priyanka Desai.</h1>
        <p>I’m a Software Engineer with 4.5+ years of experience building high-performance, scalable web and cloud applications. I enjoy creating responsive user experiences with ReactJS and TypeScript, while also developing robust back-ends using Node.js, Express.js, and Python (Django). Over the years, I’ve designed and deployed RESTful APIs services in microservices architectures, worked extensively with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Cosmos DB, and enabled real-time communication with Kafka. I’m passionate about cloud technologies and have hands-on experience scaling applications on AWS, containerizing with Docker and Kubernetes, and automating workflows through CI/CD pipelines. I also focus on monitoring and reliability, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Guided by test-driven development and Agile practices, I aim to build software that is secure, maintainable, and impactful.</p>
